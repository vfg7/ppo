# Supply Chain Optimization

Optimize your supply chain with this project that leverages TensorFlow and NumPy. 
Users can set constraints and customize parameters to tailor the optimization process to their specific supply chain scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-optimization.git
cd supply-chain-optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Customize the supply chain parameters in supply_chain.py to match your specific scenario. Run the optimization process with:
python supply_chain.py
